# Getting paid to code

## Getting a job

### How do I get a job?

Your best bet, far and away, is to get a referral. If the hiring manager, or someone else inside a company is willing to advocate for you, your chances are way better.

Working backwards, that means you need to find ways to make friends in tech, and demonstrate your skills - tech skills and soft skills.

Some ways you can do that:

- Be active and friendly in Underdog Devs Slack
- Share your journey on social media and/or a blog
- Make sure _everyone you know_ knows you're looking for a developer job
- Attend meetups and hackathons - optimize for new connections rather than lines of code

### How can I find companies that will consider applicants with criminal records?

One of your fellow Underdog Devs, @haydenbp, built a tool that collects companies who have identified themselves as Fair Chance employers. Check it out here:

Beyond that, you can type "Fair Chance software engineer" into tools like Indeed.com to get relevant results.

### When should I bring up my record? (Should I bring it up at all?)

First, know the laws in your state - and the employer's state. [This page](https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/state-laws-use-arrests-convictions-employment.html) has a state-by-state guide.

Here's a quote:

> Some states allow employers to ask about convictions only if they relate directly to the job, or require employers that consider convictions to take particular facts into account, such as how serious the crime was and whether the applicant has participated in any rehabilitation efforts. And several states now have "ban-the-box" laws, prohibiting employers from asking about any criminal history until after the applicant has an interview or receives a conditional offer of employment.

So depending on where you're applying, they may not ask, or even be permitted to ask about your history.

That said, there's no consensus on this question. 

We've definitely seen people who never heard back from possible employers after disclosing their history, or after the employer ran a background check.

We've also seen people who got hired without the issue coming up.

If you don't have an advocate, you'll have to make a tough choice about whether to disclose. Here are a few guidelines:

- Don't lie - if they ask, tell the truth
- Learn the laws in your state - it may be illegal for them to ask about anything that's not directly relevant to your job (TODO resource for this?)
- Run a background check on yourself - it doesn't cost too much, and knowing what it says will help you figure out how to talk about it to potential employers
- Get support letters from folks in tech, former employers, etc. - positive perspectives to counterbalance the negative information you have to share

### There are serious gaps in my resume - how do I deal with that?

There are a few strategies you can follow:

1. Write a functional resume which places focus on skills, rather than time spent at a job
2. Use years, not months when listing employers
3. List any volunteer work as well, especially if you did things related to the job

## Freelancing

### What does it take to get started freelancing?

Not much! It's unlikely anybody will ask you for a background check and there's no requirement to form an LLC or pass a test to start working with clients. (You definitely have to report your earnings, of course.)

Some Underdog Devs have had success on platforms like Upwork.com or seeking referrals from their network. It's a great way to get some portfolio pieces built while getting paid.

Definitely reach out in the `#freelancing` channel on Slack if you're considering this option! We're here to help.

### I'm worried about what people see when they google my name. Anything I can do about that?

For sure. The general topic you want to [research](https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=online%20reputation%20management) is "Online reputation management" - there are entire companies focused on helping with this problem, but you don't have to pay anybody to improve your situation.

The basic idea is to bury the negative content. With some planning and effort, you can control the first page of Google results for your name ... and hardly anybody looks past the first page of results.

Here are steps you can take:

- Create social media profiles under your name, and post regularly
- Create an account on Medium.com and write a couple posts
- Budget permitting, buy your name as a domain and build a portfolio site. (You can use GitHub Pages for free hosting)
- Write guest blog posts or tutorials for other sites
- Be a guest on a tech podcast
